Short description
=================

A library that supports atomic operations. Uses compiler intrinsics,
so portability is only limited to predicted compilers.

Remarks
=======

If you compile the project with C++ 2003 standard (the first ever C++ standard),
you have to use one of supported compilers. Otherwise you can use any compiler
with C++11 (2011) standard onwards.
